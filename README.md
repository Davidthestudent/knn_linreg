# knn_linreg
This project is centered around applying and understanding fundamental machine learning techniques through three distinct tasks. Each task involves working with a specific dataset and algorithm, allowing you to explore different aspects of machine learning, from classification to regression, and even writing custom implementations of algorithms.

Tasks Overview:
Implementing k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) on the Wine Dataset:

Objective: The first task involves implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on the popular Wine dataset. The Wine dataset contains various chemical properties of wines, categorized into three classes. The goal is to classify wines based on these features using the kNN algorithm.
Key Steps:
Load and preprocess the Wine dataset.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Implement the kNN algorithm using sklearn and evaluate its performance.
Visualize the decision boundaries for different values of k to understand the effect of the number of neighbors on the model's performance.
Writing an Algorithm for k-Nearest Neighbors:

Objective: The second task is to create a custom implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch. This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of how the algorithm works behind the scenes.
Key Steps:
Write a function to calculate the Euclidean distance between data points.
Implement the logic for finding the k nearest neighbors.
Develop a function that predicts the class of a new data point based on its neighbors.
Compare the performance of the custom implementation with sklearn's kNN.
Implementing Linear Regression on the Diamonds Dataset:

Objective: The third task focuses on implementing a linear regression model using the Diamonds dataset. The dataset contains various attributes of diamonds, such as carat, cut, and price. The goal is to predict the price of diamonds based on their features.
Key Steps:
Load and preprocess the Diamonds dataset.
Explore the relationship between the features and the target variable (price) using correlation analysis and visualizations.
Implement a linear regression model using sklearn to predict diamond prices.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
Interpret the coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the price prediction.
